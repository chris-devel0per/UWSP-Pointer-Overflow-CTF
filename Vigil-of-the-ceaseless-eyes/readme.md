After some testing, I revisited the challenge description. The Flag is located under "secret/flag.pdf." What if we try to access it directly via the browser?

And there we have itâ€”the Flag!

## Tips for the Developer
* Be cautious about the information you share online. Avoid disclosing the location of sensitive information; it might go unnoticed in web scans.

* Secure file permissions. Files should not be accessible by everyone!
